# Brainf-k_Interpreter

Simple command line Brainf-k interpreter in C++. It takes in a program's code as a single unbroken line and simply performs it. 
Hopefully one day will add on ability to interpret files containing code. Some non-trivial programs are written on wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), though so far I've only tested it on "Hello, World!" and a cat program.
